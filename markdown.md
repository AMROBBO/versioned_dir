# Markdown Trial

---
"This is me practicing typing in different ways"
Im not too sure what this has to do with markdown yet
---

*These are some bullet points
*And another one
*One more

1. These are numbers
1. I can use the same number and they will automatically count
1. It's not my job to count how many things I want to list

Once I finish this file, I will use the following commands:

```
You'd think the things to make the box are apostraphes but they're not
git add markdown.md
git commit -a
git push
```

I'll give you a link [here] if you want (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chryswoods/siremol.org/master/chryswoods.com/introducing_git/markdown.Rmd)

And hope that it works!
